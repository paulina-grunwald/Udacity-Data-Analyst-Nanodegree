Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: &quot;start free trial&quot;, and &quot;access course materials&quot;. If the student clicks &quot;start free trial&quot;, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks &quot;access course materials&quot;, they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked &quot;start free trial&quot;, they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. </span><span class="c2 c8"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/file/d/0ByAfiG8HpNUMakVrS0s4cGN2TjQ/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1480206745634000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIBpxxFpqWrVZdgyFQXAQvyJuU9A">This screenshot</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;shows what the experiment looks like.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn&#39;t have enough time</span><span class="c2 c13">&mdash;</span><span class="c2">without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches&#39; capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c5 c6" id="h.xd75twmqym9z"><span class="c2">Metric Choice</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Which of the following metrics would you choose to measure for this experiment and why?

If the invariant metric is a simple count that should be randomly split between the 2 groups, you can use a binomial test as demonstrated in Lesson 5. Otherwise, you will need to construct a confidence interval for a difference in proportions using a similar strategy as in Lesson 1, then check whether the difference between group values falls within that confidence level. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">If your sanity checks fail, look at the day by day data and see if you can offer any insight into what is causing the problem.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.74biaps7z91e"><span class="c2">Check for Practical and Statistical Significance</span></h3><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Next, for your evaluation metrics, calculate a confidence interval for the difference between the experiment and control groups, and check whether each metric is statistically and/or practically significance. A metric is statistically significant if the confidence interval does not include 0 (that is, you can be confident there was a change), and it is practically significant if the confidence interval does not include the practical significance boundary (that is, you can be confident there is a change that matters to the business.)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">If you have chosen multiple evaluation metrics, you will need to decide whether to use the Bonferroni correction. When deciding, keep in mind the results you are looking for in order to launch the experiment. Will the fact that you have multiple metrics make those results more likely to occur by chance than the alpha level of 0.05?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.xmm0hn19vvq9"><span class="c2">Run Sign Tests</span></h3><p class="c5"><span class="c2">For each evaluation metric, do a sign test using the day-by-day breakdown. If the sign test does not agree with the confidence interval for the difference, see if you can figure out why.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c5 c6" id="h.wj5g9dw7k8i3"><span class="c2">Make a Recommendation</span></h3><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Finally, make a recommendation. Would you launch this experiment, not launch it, dig deeper, run a follow-up experiment, or is it a judgment call? If you would dig deeper, explain what area you would investigate. If you would run follow-up experiments, briefIy describe that experiment. If it is a judgment call, explain what factors would be relevant to the decision.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c5 c6" id="h.1uci15lndv87"><span class="c2">Follow-Up Experiment: How to Reduce Early Cancellations</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c2">If you wanted to reduce the number of frustrated students who cancel early in the course, what experiment would you try?

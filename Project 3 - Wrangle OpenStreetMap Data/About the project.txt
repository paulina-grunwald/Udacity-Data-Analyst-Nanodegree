In this project my task was to choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. I had a choice to choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply chosen schema to the project.

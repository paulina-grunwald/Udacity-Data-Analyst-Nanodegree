### Scatterplot Review

```{r Scatterplot Review}
# Let's start by examining two variables in the data set.
# The scatterplot is a powerful tool to help you understand
# the relationship between two continuous variables.

# We can quickly see if the relationship is linear or not.
# In this case, we can use a variety of diamond
# characteristics to help us figure out whether
# the price advertised for any given diamond is 
# reasonable or a rip-off.

# Let's consider the price of a diamond and it's carat weight.
# Create a scatterplot of price (y) vs carat weight (x).

# Limit the x-axis and y-axis to omit the top 1% of values.

d <- diamonds


p1 <- ggplot(aes(x=carat,y=price), data = d)+
  geom_point(fill='blue', color='darkblue', shape=21)+
  xlim(quantile(d$carat,0.01),(quantile(d$carat,0.99)))+
  ylim(quantile(d$price,0.01),(quantile(d$price,0.99)))

p2 <- ggplot(aes(x=carat,y=price), data = d)+
  geom_point()+
  xlim(quantile(d$carat,0.01),(quantile(d$carat,0.99)))+
  ylim(quantile(d$price,0.01),(quantile(d$price,0.99)))

grid.arrange(p1,p2, ncol=2)

#other way of writing the code:
#xlim=c(0,quantile(diamonds$carat,0.99)) or
#scale_x_continous(lim=c(0, quantile(d$carat, 0.99)))
    
```


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=carat,y=price), data = d)+
  geom_point()+
  xlim(quantile(d$carat,0.01),(quantile(d$carat,0.99)))+
  ylim(quantile(d$price,0.01),(quantile(d$price,0.99)))
```

### Price and Carat Relationship
Response:

Seems like the linear relationship between price and carat is lost for the diamonds that have over 1.0 carats. It seems like diamonds with 1 carat have much bigger price variation and then it's hard to say if the high price is attributed only to carat weight.

```{r}
#Add on linear model

ggplot(aes(x=carat,y=price), data = d)+
  geom_point(fill='blue', color='darkblue', shape=21)+
  stat_smooth(method= 'lm', color=)+
  xlim(quantile(d$carat,0.01),(quantile(d$carat,0.99)))+
  ylim(quantile(d$price,0.01),(quantile(d$price,0.99)))

```

### ggpairs Function
Notes:

```{r ggpairs Function}
# install these if necessary
install.packages('GGally')
install.packages('scales')
install.packages('memisc')
install.packages('lattice')
install.packages('MASS')
install.packages('car')
install.packages('reshape')
install.packages('plyr')

# load the ggplot graphics package and the others
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(memisc)
library(gridExtra)


# sample 10,000 diamonds from the data set
set.seed(20022012)
diamond_samp <- d[sample(1:length(d$price), 10000), ]
ggpairs(diamond_samp, 
  lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", shape = I('.'))), 
  upper = list(combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I('.'))))
```

What are some things you notice in the ggpairs output?

### The Demand of Diamonds
Notes:

```{r The Demand of Diamonds}
# Create two histograms of the price variable
# and place them side by side on one output image.

# We've put some code below to get you started.

# The first plot should be a histogram of price
# and the second plot should transform
# the price variable using log10.

# Set appropriate bin widths for each plot.
# ggtitle() will add a title to each histogram.

plot1 <- qplot(x=price, data=d,  fill = I('blue'),binwidth = 100)+
  ggtitle('Diamonds price histogram')

plot2 <- qplot(x=price, data=d, fill='orange',binwidth = 0.01)+
  scale_x_log10()+
  ggtitle('Diamonds price histograme (log10)')

grid.arrange(plot1,plot2, ncol=2)
```

***

### Connecting Demand and Price Distributions
Notes:

First we can see break in the price (very low prices) at around 200. In the transformed plot we can see something close to binomial distribution. We see two picks which can be related to poorer and richer customers.
***

### Scatterplot Transformation

```{r Scatterplot Transformation}
qplot(carat, price, data=d)+
  scale_y_continuous(trans=log10_trans())+
  ggtitle('Price (log10)by Carat')
```

### Create a new function to transform the carat variable

```{r cuberoot transformation}
cuberoot_trans = function() trans_new('cuberoot', transform = function(x) x^(1/3),
                                      inverse = function(x) x^3)
```

#### Use the cuberoot_trans function

Resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1wB1rHAYzQ&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP

```{r Use cuberoot_trans}
ggplot(aes(carat, price), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat')
```

***

### Overplotting Revisited

```{r Sort and Head Tables}
head(sort(table(d$carat), decreasing = T))
head(sort(table(d$price), decreasing = T))
```


```{r Overplotting Revisited}
ggplot(aes(carat, price), data = d) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=1/5, size=3/4) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat')

#or geom_point(position='jitter')
```

### Other Qualitative Factors
Notes:

***

### Price vs. Carat and Clarity

Alter the code below.
```{r Price vs. Carat and Clarity}
# install and load the RColorBrewer package
install.packages('RColorBrewer')
library(RColorBrewer)


# Adjust the code below to color the points by clarity.

# A layer called scale_color_brewer() has 
# been added to adjust the legend and
# provide custom colors.

ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color =clarity), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, position = 'jitter') +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
    guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T,
    override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
    breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
    breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat and Clarity')
```

***

### Clarity and Price
Response:

Obviously clarity has quite an impact on the price. IF clarity diamonds are much more expensive than I1 diamonds so diamonds with lower clarity are cheaper than those that have higher clarity.

***

### Price vs. Carat and Cut

Alter the code below.
```{r Price vs. Carat and Cut}
ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, position = 'jitter') +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T,
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat and Clarity')
```

### Price vs. Carat and Color

Alter the code below.
```{r Price vs. Carat and Color}
ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, position = 'jitter') +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
                     guide = guide_legend(title = Cut, reverse = T,
                                          override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat and Cut')
```

### Linear Models in R

### Building the Linear Model
Notes:

```{r Building the Linear Model}
m1 <- lm(I(log(price)) ~ I(carat^(1/3)), data = diamonds)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + carat)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + cut)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + color)
m5 <- update(m4, ~ . + clarity)
mtable(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5)
```

Notice how adding cut to our model does not help explain much of the variance
in the price of diamonds. This fits with out exploration earlier.

***

### Model Problems
Video Notes:

Research:
(Take some time to come up with 2-4 problems for the model)
(You should 10-20 min on this)

### A Bigger, Better Data Set
Notes:

```{r A Bigger, Better Data Set}
install.package('bitops')
install.packages('RCurl')
library('bitops')
library('RCurl')

diamondsurl = getBinaryURL("https://raw.github.com/solomonm/diamonds-data/master/BigDiamonds.Rda")
load(rawConnection(diamondsurl))
```

The code used to obtain the data is available here:
https://github.com/solomonm/diamonds-data

## Building a Model Using the Big Diamonds Data Set
Notes:

```{r Building a Model Using the Big Diamonds Data Set}

```

## Predictions

Example Diamond from BlueNile:
Round 1.00 Very Good I VS1 $5,601

```{r}
#Be sure youâ€™ve loaded the library memisc and have m5 saved as an object in your workspace.
thisDiamond = data.frame(carat = 1.00, cut = "V.Good",
                         color = "I", clarity="VS1")
modelEstimate = predict(m5, newdata = thisDiamond,
                        interval="prediction", level = .95)
```

Evaluate how well the model predicts the BlueNile diamond's price. Think about the fitted point estimate as well as the 95% CI.
